# ADR 001: Codex managed root-route ownership

Status: Accepted

## Context

A managed Codex TUI and tools it launches share environment variables, an MCP
bridge identity, and a route-control directory. A nested `codex exec`, review,
or interactive Codex can therefore present the same managed client ID as its
parent. Client identity alone cannot decide which thread the supervisor may
resume or which thread a resident App Server may route.

This caused an ephemeral review thread to replace the parent restart target.
The supervisor then attempted `codex resume` for a thread that was intentionally
not persisted.

## Decision

Each managed TUI launch owns one `codex-root-session.json` registration in its
private route-control directory. An explicit session argument may seed it. For
fresh sessions and selector forms such as `resume --last`, the root user-prompt
hook registers the actual Codex thread before agent tools can launch children.
Registration is first-writer-only until the owning supervisor explicitly resets
it for a new TUI attachment.

Both restart and resident App Server transports accept a route only when its
client ID, session ID, and declared root agree with that registration. Nested
one-shot hooks do not register roots or emit route requests. Managed child
launches scrub inherited root ownership along with the existing client and
control-directory identity variables.

The App Server proxy also matches the actual `turn/start` thread before it
consumes a registered route. A turn for another thread leaves the root route
pending. Every control-directory consumer distinguishes `*.route.json` from
the root-registration file.

## Consequences

- A child may still send telemetry through the shared workflow binding, but it
  cannot become the parent's restart or next-turn routing target.
- A fresh root must receive its user-prompt hook before its first route can be
  accepted. Missing or stale hook installation therefore fails closed.
- A new TUI attachment to a resident App Server replaces the prior attachment's
  root registration, preserving one active routing owner per managed client.
- Rollback is limited to reverting the root-registration checks and hook
  registration; no remote data or Git history migration is involved.

## Rejected alternatives

- Trusting the first same-client route allowed a nested process to self-elect.
- Trusting only `STATEWRIGHT_CLIENT_ID` repeated the original collision.
- Relying only on process ancestry was platform-sensitive and did not protect
  the resident App Server consumer.
- Treating `resume --last` as a session ID confused a selector with the durable
  thread that Codex resolves at runtime.
